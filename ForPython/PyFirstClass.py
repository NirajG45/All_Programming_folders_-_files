# this is simple python program to writing all basic operations...

# ---------Sum of two numbers-----------
# first = int(input("Enter first Number: "))
# second = int(input("Enter second Number: "))

# print("sum of both numbers: ", first + second)

# --------Concatenation of two Strings-------
# String1 = "Niraj"
# String2 = "_Avenger"

# finalString = String1 + String2

# print(String1 + String2)
# print(len(finalString))

# ---------Finding the Area of Square---------
# side = float(input("Enter value of square: "))

# print("Area of Square", side, "is: ", side ** 2)

# -------Finding Average--------
# a = int(input("Enter first Number: "))
# b = int(input("Enter second Number: "))

# print("average of both numbers: ", (a+b)/2)

# ----------All Arithmetic Opeartion----------
# Num1 = int(input("Enter first Number: "))
# Num2 = int(input("Enter second Number: "))

# print("\nSum of both numbers is:", Num1+Num2)
# print("\nSubtraction of both numbers is:", Num1-Num2)
# print("\nMultipation of both numbers is:", Num1*Num2)
# print("\nDivision of both numbers is:", Num1/Num2)
# print("\nModules of both numbers is:", Num1%Num2)
